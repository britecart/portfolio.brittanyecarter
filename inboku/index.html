    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I am half-human, half-oni high school girl who transferred to Room 4 of the Maison de Ayakashi in order to live alone. I yearn to be independent and but constantly worry about not being able to communicate with other people properly. I was bullied as a child and developed a habit of rudely slighting other people whenever someone tries to interact with me. I hate it! </p><p>I have SS agent and servant named Sōshi Miketsukami, who has the blood of a fox-spirit. Whom has an extreme willingness to serve me, but he's a great guy, I guess. Since he wrote the letters that were supposed to be from my fiance. I also have a annoyance from my childhood named Renshō Sorinozuka. He's always trying to cheer me up! But living at the Maison de Ayakashi isn't the worst thing. </p>
