    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>He is the annoying tenant of Room 3, an Ittan-momen half-demon. He has known me since we were children and earns Sōshi's trust because of it. His SS Agent is Nobara, whom he has a close relationship with. Evene though many girls confess their love for him, but he always rejects them, because while he can reincarnate into basically the exact same person again, humans will not or so he says. </p><p>He has a very lazy personality but he still has time to make sure I am getting along with the other tenants and making friends. He is like an annoying older brother.</p>
