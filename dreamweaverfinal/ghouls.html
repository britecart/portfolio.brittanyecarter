	  <h2>Ken Kaneki</h2>
	<p>The main protagonist of the story, Ken Kaneki is a 19-year-old university freshman that receives an organ transplant from Rize, who was trying to kill him before she was struck by a fallen I-beam and seemingly killed. After the operation Kaneki develops ghoul-like tendencies and characteristics, and his rationality begins to wane. As one that now doesn't belong to humans or ghouls he struggles to keep his ghoul identity secret, always fighting against his ghoul side while trying to continue to live like a normal human. He later works as a waiter for Anteiku under Yoshimura's guidance. After his fight with a CCG investigator named Amon he gains the name Eye Patch because of his mask's design and becomes somewhat famous after a ghoul saw him defeating the investigator. He loves to read and is normally quiet and reserved but can also be calculating when fighting. He has a bad trait of easily trusting strangers which sometimes puts him in life-threatening situations.</p>

Before leaving, she killed the ghouls that were in charge and caused a shift in power. She is known as the "Binge Eater" by investigators and like Ken, she was very fond of reading. </p>

She blends in well with human society and believes that keeping one's ghoul identity is of top most priority. She is usually a reckless and violent individual stemming from the fugitive life she had to live after CCG killed her father when she was very young. She reluctantly became Kaneki's guide to the ghoul world and his training partner, although she doesn't like Kaneki much and often expresses her dislike towards him. She later comes to be known as Rabbit after her attack on some investigators, killing one of them in the process. She takes up the role as Hinami's guardian after her parents are killed by investigators and is fiercely protective of her.</p>

Like Tōka, he has blends in well with human society, he even has a human girlfriend Nishino Kimi who is aware of his ghoul identity, and is well known at the university. He seems to have a great dislike towards both CCG and Aogiri ghouls saying that they are the same and disgusting for creating "fake" ghouls. His kagune is a tail-like formation that wraps around his leg and enhances the strength of his kicks beyond those of his rank. </p>

     <h2>Yoshimura</h2>
	<p>The manager of Anteiku coffee shop, also known as the Non-Killing Owl. The name came from him pretending to be the One-Eyed Owl to cover up her behavior and refusing to kill Ghoul Investigators. He is a very kind and reasonable ghoul that provides aid and food to ghouls that are incapable of hunting on their own, such as Hinami. He takes Ken in after he becomes a half-ghoul and teaches him the ways in which ghouls can blend in with humans. He has shown to be able to reform ghouls from their violent ways.</p>

      <figcaption>Uta</figcaption></figure>
	  <h2>Uta</h2>
	<p>A ghoul that owns Hysy ArtMask Studio, in the 4th ward, he makes masks for both ghoul and human customers alike. He looks very different from the other ghouls in the series, featuring tattoos spanning his body, multiple piercings, a strange haircut and interesting fashion choices. His eyes are his most striking feature, as his irises are permanently red and his sclera permanently black, implying his ghoul powers are always active. Despite his appearance he is a very calm ghoul, and speaks very kindly and amusingly, with a rather aloof personality. He is known to CCG as "No Face", because of his mask's design. He possesses a level of regeneration beyond nearly any other ghoul revealed in the series, as well as a unique shapeshifting power that allows him to change his facial features and his voice with near perfect accuracy.</p>

     <h2>Shū Tsukiyama</h2>
	<p>A troublesome ghoul of the 20th ward with a well-known reputation: ghouls wouldn't even get involved with him. He is known as the "Gourmet" by investigators and is one of the most difficult ghouls to capture, especially because he hails from a powerful and rich family of ghouls with connections in the government. He is a part of the "Ghoul Restaurant" under the alias MM. He is a very powerful, cunning, smug, and fashionable ghoul and was also an acquaintance of Rize. Like both Ken and Rize, he is an avid reader. He sometimes says words or phrases in either English, Spanish, French or Italian, and develops an obsession for Ken because of his seemingly unique quality of being human and ghoul. He is very athletic and proficient in martial arts.</p>

     <h2>Yakumo Ōmori</h2>
	<p>A deranged Executive of Aogiri, he was nicknamed "Jason" due to his brutality and habit of wearing a hockey mask and went by the alias Yamori (Gecko). While imprisoned by CCG in the past, he was tortured by the point of insanity and developed a love of torturing others. He was known as a serial cannibal, and targeted other Ghouls to torture and devour. Yamori tricked Kaneki into surrendering to him in exchange for sparing hostages, and tortured him for 10 days straight. After breaking free, Kaneki defeated him and devoured his kagune before leaving him to die. </p>
