	  <h2>Kōtarō Amon</h2>
	<p>Amon is a Rank 1 Anti-Ghoul Investigator and was a partner of Kureo Mado up until his death which was when his partner was switched to Akira Mado up until he disappeared. When he was a little boy he used to live in an orphanage managed by the priest, until he found out that the priest was a ghoul killing his friends. He has a very strong sense of justice and believes that he must make this 'Wrong World' right by killing the ghouls whose murders create orphans, he is very dedicated to his job and begins to work even harder after Kureo is killed. He fought Ken and he lost. However, Ken let him go during their first encounter. During his time as an investigator he would sometimes be playfully teased by his late partner Mado, Shinohara and later by Akira after she became his subordinate. As a human he was extremely fond of sweet food but hated anything that was spicy. Despite his initial hatred towards ghouls Amon has shown to be interested in Kaneki's story and even after getting badly injured and losing his arm to Kaneki when they last meet, he refuses to die, so that Kaneki would not be prosecuted.</p>

	  <h2>Kureo Mado</h2>
	<p>He was a First-Class Investigator and was Kōtarō Amon's partner and mentor. A very experienced and ruthless fighter. He was more than a challenge even for the physically superior ghoul and always trusted his intuition, which was never wrong. His ultimate downfall came from the fact that he was obsessed with quinques (weapons made from the ghouls' kagune). And while fighting Tōka and Hinami, he let his guard down by his fascination with the latter and being killed by them. His daughter, Akira, worked with his partner Kōtarō Amon after his death. His goal was to get revenge on the One-Eyed Owl for killing his wife. Despite his mercilessness towards ghouls, he was a very loving and devoted father.</p>

	<p>A young human boy that was raised by a ghoul called Big Madam until he was taken in by the CCG. He was promoted to a ranked 2 investigator within a year, indicating that he's very capable of exterminating ghouls. Jūzō is very independent and tends to not cooperate with his fellow comrades and superiors. His profiles says he likes candy, his Mama (the ghoul that raised him) and ghoul hunting. His behavior is very childish and carefree and he his often seen talking with himself. He calls his other self Rei (his former name). </p>

     <h2>Akira Mado</h2>
	<p>Kureo's daughter and a Ghoul Investigator like him, she became Kōtarō's partner after her father's death. She is an intelligent woman and seems to be always serious about work and her daily routine in general. Like her father, she has deep insight and intuition that helps her in investigation and determining what is going on around her while on the field. After Kōtarō was declared KIA, she became Haise's team leader and the overseer of the Quinx Squad. </p>

     <figcaption>Hide Nagachika</figcaption></figure>
     <h2>Hideyoshi Nagachika</h2>
	<p>He is Ken's best friend, nicknamed "Hide". He has a sharp intuition, so much so that while Ken tried to keep his ghoul identity hidden from him, Hideyoshi seemed to know something is weird about his best friend. Hide has proven to be intelligent and very observant, even figuring out that Rabbit (Tōka) was not Hinami like what CCG had first thought. He will also go to extreme lengths for those he cares about, like venturing to Aogiri's hideout and putting a tracking device on Yamori. After Ken disappeared, Hideyoshi joined the Anti-Ghoul forces in order to learn about his whereabouts, eventually being promoted to Rookie Investigator and partnered with Kōtarō and Akira. He eventually reunites with Ken and reveals to him that he knows he is Eye Patch, getting himself seriously injured during the raid of Anteiku in the anime.</p>
