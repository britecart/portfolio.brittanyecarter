	  <h1>Characters</h1>
	  <h2 id="enma">Ai Enma</h2>
	  <p>The main protagonist of the series, who is arguably an anti-heroine as well. With long, straight black layered hair in a hime-cut, ruby-red eyes and pale skin, she is a spiritual entity with a tragic past, who lives in a place frozen in time as it basks in eternal sunset, along with her grandmother. There are 3 dolls visible near the computer, which are her companions. With an old computer inside their house, Ai is able to receive the names of the clients who have used the website, and delivers their revenge. She normally wears a black school girl uniform, but always wears a black kimono with floral designs when delivering the vengeance of a client. Whenever a contract is fulfilled, after the targeted person suffers the hellish hallucinations which exploit their flaws and crimes, she appears to the condemned and recites the following rite, before rowing them to eternal damnation.</p>
	  <h2>Michiru</h2>
	  <p>Michiru is a mysterious young girl who suddenly appear before Ai and her companions in season 4. She does not seem to recall who she is and where she came from, aside from being a supernatural. Michiru questions the morale of Ai's job as the Hell Girl, and also the ugly truth of human nature. She had a short teal colored hair, jade-green eyes; with a beauty mark below her right eye, and on her neck. Her attire is a long-sleeved green dress, with white leggings that covers her legs.</p>
	  <h2>Kikuri</h2>
	  <p>An enigmatic girl introduced in Futakomori. Some people said she is similar to Nemesis (mythology) in Greek as goddess of vengeance. Little is known about her except the fact she is not human. She can wander freely between the mortal plane and Ai's house in the sunset world, sometimes interfering with her and her companions' job; in one instance, she brought a human into the sunset world out of mischief. In stark contrast to Ai, Kikuri has completely purple eyes and her personality is far more childish than Ai's. She has stated that she likes Ai, and some of her actions and use of powers seem to be causing the greatest amount of suffering and fear possible. She seems to take delight in acts of low-level destructiveness, such as chopping off flowers or destroying anything that Ai cares for. She has shown incredible skills with her loincloth, using it to catch or hit objects with considerable accuracy and skill. Despite the fact that she wreaks havoc freely, she has only taken orders from Ai alone. </p>
